<h2 class="center"><b>Unopened: The Issue of the Textbook in Lawrenceville’s Classrooms
</b>
</h2>

<p>According to the US Department of Education, the average American high school student spends between $700 and $1,000 per year on textbooks. The question arises: do they actually add that much value to the educational experience? At Lawrenceville, the problem is even worse. Textbooks are ridiculously priced and difficult to learn from — and that’s assuming that they are even opened in the first place.
</p>

<p>
    Take, for example, the use of textbooks throughout the required sophomore science course, Inquiries Into Chemical and Physical Sciences (ICAPS). Each student was required to shell out $100 dollars on the course’s required textbook. For such a large expenditure, students have reason to hope, at least, that the book will actually help them learn the material through valuable insights. But alas, in the case of the 2020 ICAPS course, the textbook was never even opened. If ICAPS instructors can sufficiently teach the material without a textbook, why require one? In the case that the textbook was necessitated by some logistical oversight, its requirement becomes all the more trivial. 

</p>

<p>
    Even in classes where textbooks are adamantly utilized, they still serve an arguably fruitless purpose. For example, in the Honors U.S. History Survey, some classes read Eric Foner’s Give Me Liberty almost every night. Though its pages present a much-needed historical framework for the course, for some instructors, it could be easily replaced. One teacher of the course “would much prefer to use primary sources exclusively.” While students have to learn the history in some way, textbooks often present historical events inseparable from a greater narrative, hindering the readers from drawing their own, unique takeaways. To this end, textbook-dominated learning limits students to a one-dimensional understanding — students are convinced of the same historical narrative time and time again, with deficient resources for true, personal exploration that leads to more robust learning.
</p>

<p>
    Students don’t like them, either. In many math courses, many courses are structured such that students learn from the textbooks rather than the teachers. Each night, pre-calculus students are often assigned — before their actual math problems — a couple of textbook pages to “study.” By studying these pages, students grasp the concepts before practicing them with problems. To no one’s surprise, students often struggle to learn from the textbooks, and show up to class the next day with incomplete homework. Only then will teachers clarify the concepts. But if things worked in the reverse order — if teachers taught the students the concepts in class before assigning homework — students would grasp the concepts better because by and large, good teachers teach better than textbooks. One student put it this way: “The self-taught process of learning teaches kids to be more resourceful… but [in my experience] this has not been a model for mastery. I will spend a long time learning the material well enough to complete the assignment, and have the gaps in my understanding shored up in class, but it often feels like the base I am starting from is too weak to really handle the concept.” But hey, at least students actually use their Math textbooks.
</p>

<p>
    The issue of biases in the textbooks at the school is an entirely different problem — but one that certainly exists and affects students’ educational experience. In Lies My Teacher Told Me, American sociologist and historian James Loewon argues that though American history is deeply rooted in social stratification, publishers are pressured by lobbying organizations to paint America as a land of opportunity, misrepresenting its historical narrative altogether. “Perhaps the most robust such lobby is Education Research Analysts, led by Mel Gabler of Texas,”  argues Loewon. “Gabler’s stable of right-wing critics regards even alleging that a textbook contains some class analysis as a devastating criticism.” One writer from the ERA goes as far as to suggest that “Formulating issues in terms of class is unacceptable, perhaps even un-American.” If ridiculously expensive textbooks will serve as the basis for teaching Lawrenceville courses, then we better be certain of two things: they’re used, and they’re accurate. But evaluating the biases of these materials is an arduous process to be done by individual academic departments. For now, let’s make sure courses use their textbooks. Then, we can worry about making sure those textbooks are accurate. 
</p>

<p>
    The Vistas Textbook –  a required material for all students taking Spanish – can be found on both smaller online textbook stores like The Ivy Bookshop and larger distributors like Amazon for $150 and below. But the system that Lawrenceville uses – eCampus – sells students the same textbook, in the same condition, for $360 – marked up $200. Even if students know about these alternative options, they’re unlikely to buy them. Why? Lawrenceville has nested itself as an organization inside the eCampus ecosystem: students log on at the beginning of each academic year to a dashboard of expensive — marked up, in fact — textbooks they need to purchase for their classes. If they take the cheaper route on another site, they risk making a mistake and ending up with a different version, or long shipping times. In the end, Lawrenceville wastes its students' money by limiting them to a central online store, associated with the school, where already expensive textbooks are made even more so. 
</p>

<p>
    Solving the problem will not be easy. First, rather than outsourcing the management to eCampus — who overcharge for textbooks year after year— Lawrenceville will need to become the center of textbook distribution. If the Bunn Library bought back students’ textbooks (at a discount) at the end of the year — even just for two or three years — they could probably provide all students with textbooks for years to follow, assuming that a course doesn’t need a renewed edition each year. And this system is no new invention – universities across the country use similar methods. The next consideration is actually using the textbooks. If a class can operate without their textbook, they should do so — most students will appreciate that, academically and fiscally. Indeed, the academic advancement of Lawrenceville requires a gradual departure from textbook-based learning. Lastly, Lawrenceville will have to consider the pedagogical benefits of the textbook, questioning the place of them in curriculums altogether. Textbooks are often expensive, biased, unliked, or unused. Then again, they have been a part of Lawrenceville’s courses since its founding. Lawrenceville’s administration doesn’t need to eradicate textbooks altogether — but it will need to reconsider the way they are bought and utilized. A course’s textbook, then, must be used sparingly enough to not replace its teacher, but used frequently enough to make it worth buying. Here’s the bottom line: if teachers expect students to buy textbooks, students deserve, at a minimum, to use those textbooks in productive ways.
