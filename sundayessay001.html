<h2 class="center"><b>Buried in Homework: How “Helpful” Academic Regulations Hurt Students and their Mental Health</b>
</h2>

<p>The American Psychological Association reports that during the school year, modern-day students experience higher
    stress levels than adults. Heavy workloads are detrimental for their mental health, depriving them of sleep and time
    they could be spending with their friends and family.
</p>

<p>
    But for most students, the problem comes from the amount of homework, not the homework itself. Students are fine
    doing thirty minutes of practice each night, but when they have to decide between completing three hours a night and
    tanking their grade point averages, school comes to consume their lives. At a selection of top-tier boarding schools
    like Lawrenceville, the situation is even worse. Students at these schools spend an average of 17 hours a week on
    homework— more than twice the workload of public school students. The students are burdened with massive workloads;
    their parents are burdened with massive tuition costs. But for many, it's well worth it— Lawrenceville's
    matriculation statistics are some of the best in the country.
</p>

<p>
    There is something peculiar about Lawrenceville's purported devotion to students' mental health, especially when
    looking at the crushing homework system. Many of the administration's efforts, although well-intentioned, are
    futile. Take the “Time Rule,” for instance. In every class, students can only be assigned a certain amount of work —
    30 minutes, 40 minutes, or 50 minutes, based on the class’ academic rigor — in order to stop a single teacher from
    overwhelming his or her students.
</p>

<p>
    If any ordinary student — let's use John for example — can't complete their work within the allotted time slot, John
    can just tell his compassionate, understanding teacher the following day, and they'll surely work something out. No
    worries, right? In practice, however, most teachers will still expect John to complete the work when he has more
    time later on in the week. The work doesn't disappear— it piles on. By the end of the week, John is swimming in
    homework. He hasn't been saved by the system that pretends to prioritize his mental health— he's been screwed over
    by it.
</p>

<p>
    Even worse, overwhelmed students who try to use the Time Rule to manage their busy lives miss out on key concepts,
    hindering their ability to both participate in class and to perform well on assessments. If a student has a Harkness
    discussion about a reading that they couldn't finish, they may receive points off, simply because they work slower
    than their peers. More importantly, missing out on practice activities and readings will translate to lower scores
    on assessments. After all, how can a student be expected to take a quiz on a concept that they weren't able to read
    about? The Time Rule will save the student from being penalized for not completing all of the homework, but the
    resulting gaps in their understanding mean their grade is likely to suffer regardless. And students agree— one
    student said that, “Usually [his] homework, especially in Humanities, ends up being well over 50 minutes,” but that
    he “toughs it out” because he knows that if he doesn’t , “he’ll end up being behind.”
</p>

<p>
    The timing rule isn’t all bad, though. Some student-athletes who get back to campus late at night after late
    practices, games, and meets rely on it to get by. One tri-varsity student-athlete said: “During basketball season, I
    would say I tell teachers that I didn’t have enough time to complete my homework maybe twice a week, but it all
    depends on games. I don’t know what I would do if I had to get everything done on time, every day though.”
</p>

<p>
    And let us not forget: students at Lawrenceville are often hyper-fixated on their teacher's perceptions of them. Coming into class unprepared and explaining to the teacher that the work that they assigned the previous night was simply unmanageable could reflect poorly on their work ethic, efficiency, and intelligence, especially if their peers did complete the assignment. The result? Most students will sacrifice sleep and necessary relaxation time to finish assignments that they're not even supposed to have. In the end, it's not the thoughtless professor who will face the consequences— it will be their students, silently exhausting themselves each night, doing everything in their power to get the grade they want. And in an environment like Lawrenceville, can you blame them?
</p>

<p>
    When Major Assignment Week arrives, these measures are thrown out the window altogether. The week is riddled with
    work so intense— research papers, cumulative tests, and high-stakes projects— that adherence to the homework timing
    rules is almost laughable. So-called "support systems" vanish when students need them most; so much for mental
    health.
</p>

<p>
    The problem is clear to see and easy to criticize, but finding a solution is naturally much harder. If Lawrenceville
    got rid of Major Assignments Week altogether, students would have more space between their assignments, as opposed
    to one week of intense, back-to-back, highly important essays and tests. The Time Rule has great intentions, but the
    way it manifests often hurts students more than it helps them. It’s rare — if not impossible — to see a teacher
    actually change their syllabus and amend the amount of homework they assign based on feedback from their students.
    Usually, the result of the Time Rule is that one or two students who rely on it simply end up doing less work— their
    lives become easier, but the course doesn’t change. Not always, though. One student said that their History teacher
    promises students that if the homework is too long, he will simply assign less. This way, students feeling
    overwhelmed with homework does not manifest as a recurrent, persistent problem. This way, the Time Rule works how
    it’s supposed to.
</p>

<p>
    While Lawrenceville’s academic regulations are backed by great intentions, often they manifest in unproductive and hurtful ways. If teachers can change the way they view the Time Rule and really engage with the feedback they receive from students, the rule can work effectively and elegantly, just how it was intended. If Lawrenceville can create a more balanced, less stressful academic schedule that prioritizes students’ mental health, it will make for a more enriching, natural, all-around improved academic experience.
